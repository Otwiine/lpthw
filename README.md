# Learn Python 3 the Hard Way 
This repository contains my completed exercises and notes as I work through Zed A. Shaw’s Learn Python 3 the Hard Way, a hands-on programming book designed to teach Python from the ground up.

I received this book as a gift, and it sat unused for a while. When I eventually got into programming, I realized how helpful it was, and I wish I had started with it much earlier.

From time to time, I revisit and redo the exercises to strengthen and reinforce what I’ve learned.
